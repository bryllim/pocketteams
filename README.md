## About The Project

PocketTeams allows your team to stay organized, sync, and plan your project in one common environment, allowing them to discuss tasks in one shared space. We provide a professional working environment in which you can simply collaborate from anywhere. From forming a team and organizing projects to assigning tasks and keeping track of progress, we've got you covered.
